/*
Estimate the value of π by using a Monte Carlo method.
Take `points` samples of random x and y values on a
[0,1][0,1] plane. Calculating the length of the diagonal
tells us whether the point lies inside, or outside a
quarter circle running from 0,1 to 1,0. The ratio of the
number of points inside to outside gives us an
approximation of π/4.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pi_30K.gif
for a visualization of how this works.
